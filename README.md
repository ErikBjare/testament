Last will and Testament
=======================

The last will and testament of me, Erik BjÃ¤reholt, in case of my untimely (legal) death.

Last will
---------

My last will is to have a high-quality cryopreservation, to hopefully prevent [information-theoretic death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information-theoretic_death), and let me see another day in the distant future.

### Cryopreservation

Cryopreservation is to be provided by Tomorrow Biostasis GmbH.

In case of my death or life-threatening injury, immediately contact Tomorrow Biostasis by calling `+49 30 629 385 37`, or by navigating to https://tmwbio.org

To ensure full, timely, and successful cryopreservation, my organs are not be donated for other purposes.

### Personal data

I wish for my personal data to be published in the public domain, this includes:

 - Health data
 - Quantified self data
 - Diaries & notes

This data should hopefully be retrievable by family members, but needs to be handled with care for others' privacy.

### Ceremony

My only wish for my ceremony at the time of writing is to have someone recite the following passage by Carl Sagan in his 1994 book "Pale Blue Dot":

> Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.
>
> The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.
>
> Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves. 

Testament
---------

In the event of my death, I wish for my remaining assets (after covering debts & liabilities) to be distributed in the following order/priority:

 - Family: any real estate, as well as up to 10M SEK [1]
 - Friends: up to 10M SEK [1]
   - If a list has not been provided by the time of my death, it is to be decided by my family.
 - A foundation in my name that invests in the market and uses the excess to support the following causes, in equal parts, using any remaining funds:
   - Scientific advancement within medicine and emerging technologies
   - Reduction of existential risk [2]
   - Global health, poverty alleviation, and social causes [2]

Thoughts & reflections
----------------------

It might seem morbid for a 27 year old to ponder his own death to the point of arranging cryopreservation and writing a document like this. 

My motivations are that I:

 1. Strongly wish for future generations to flourish. My words cannot possibly express the intensity with which I experience this desire.
 2. Would hate for my lived experiences to, unnecessarily, turn to dust. Better frozen than rotten or burned.
 3. As lucky as I have been throughout my life, I acknowledge that the tide may turn at any time. You never know which day might be your last.

Notes
-----

 - This is to be considered a work in progress until the time of legal death.
 - This testament has, at time of writing, not undergone legal review nor been notarized.
 - Any commits/changes to this document should be signed with my most recent PGP key.
 - This document may not represent the full last will and testament, but should align with supplementary materials provided by notarized documents.
